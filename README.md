Heating System Monitor

An ESP-NOW-based solution to monitor heating system activity without direct integration. This project logs heating events to a Google Sheets spreadsheet, providing a simple and effective way to track heating usage over time.

Overview

This project uses three ESP32 microcontrollers communicating via ESP-NOW: one for outside temperature, one for blower sound detection (using Blower_Slave.ino), and one as the master to consolidate communications and log heating system activity. The system operates independently of the heating system’s internal controls, making it a non-intrusive monitoring solution.

Features

Wireless Monitoring: Employs ESP-NOW for efficient, low-latency communication between devices.

Non-Invasive Setup: Monitors heating activity without requiring direct integration with the heating system.

Data Logging: Records heating events to a Google Sheets spreadsheet and local LittleFS for easy access and analysis. Built-in FTP for viewing ESP32 log file.

Visual Indicators: Includes LED indicators to display system status and activity.

Components

ESP-Now_Master.ino: Firmware for the master ESP32 device responsible for consolidating data and sending it to Google Sheets.

ESP-Now_Slave.ino: Firmware for the slave ESP32 device that measures outside temperature using a BME280 sensor.

Blower_Slave.ino: Firmware for the second slave ESP32 detecting blower sound using DSP bandpass filtering.

Google Script --Heating System Monitor.txt: Google Apps Script to handle incoming data and log it to Google Sheets.

Setup Instructions

Hardware Setup

Master Device:

Connect the ESP32 to a sensor for temperature (MCP9808) and optional MLX90614 infrared sensor.

Upload the ESP-Now_Master.ino firmware.

Slave Device (Temperature):

Connect the ESP32 to a BME280 sensor for outside temperature measurement.

Upload the ESP-Now_Slave.ino firmware.

Slave Device (Blower Sound Detection):

Set up a microphone with DSP bandpass filtering for blower sound detection.

Upload the Blower_Slave.ino firmware.

Software Setup

Google Sheets:

Create a new Google Sheet to store heating event data.

Open the Script Editor (Extensions > Apps Script).

Paste the contents of Google Script --Heating System Monitor.txt into the editor.

Deploy the script as a web app and note the URL.

ESP32 Configuration:

Update the WEB_APP_URL variable in the firmware with the URL obtained from the Google Apps Script deployment.

Ensure all ESP32 devices are configured with correct Wi-Fi credentials and within range for ESP-NOW communication.

Usage

Once set up, the master device coordinates data from both slave devices and sends a formatted string (key-value) to the Google Apps Script web app, which logs the event to the perpetual Google Sheet.
